#    - Create a new service in Railway dashboard
#    - Set it as a "Cron" type service
#    - Configure: POST https://your-app.railway.app/external/football/scheduler/smart-sync
#    - Schedule: */15 * * * * (every 15 mins)
#
# 2. Use external cron service (free options):
#    - cron-job.org (free, reliable)
#    - EasyCron
#    - GitHub Actions scheduled workflow
#
# Endpoints to call:
# - Every 15 mins: POST /external/football/scheduler/smart-sync
# - Weekly (Sun 11pm): POST /external/football/scheduler/weekly-refresh
